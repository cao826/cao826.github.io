	I am an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.
	I've recently had to re-write my website from scratch because of a technical error. (But it's almost done!)
	Soon enough, I will be posting some expository stuff on math, computer science, and updates on my research.
	The site will continue to be constructed. Feel free to stop by and see the progress. Or not.

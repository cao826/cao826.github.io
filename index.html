	I am an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.
	I've recently had to re-write my website from scratch because of a technical error. (But it's almost done!)
	Soon enough, I will be posting some expository stuff on math, computer science, and updates on my research.
	The site will continue to be constructed. Feel free to stop by and see the progress. Or not.

	<p> <h2> Update </h2> </p>
	<p> Soon all the links on this page will go live.
		I will post some dummy articles so I can get the code written for the Archive
		and clean up the post layout.
		These posts will not contain any substantial content and you can ignore
		them.

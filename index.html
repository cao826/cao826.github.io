	<p>I am Carlos Olivares, an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.
	I originally had a much better website design, but for some reason I could not get it to deploy.
	I am taking this as an opportunity to re-write a better website, and I have decided to deploy it
	from the very start so I know that I do not have to worry about it 500 lines of code later.
	</p>
	<p> The website will be constructed live as a result. Feel free to stop by and see the progress. Or not.</p>

	<p> Sincerely,</p>
	<p> Carlos </p>
